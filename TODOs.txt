- add the password change
- add the profile change (photo and other info)
- add the link for the email confirmation (there should be a link to the site)
- add the logic to verify the token



- add the logic to save the file for the restart as a/wifi
- deploy django in prod to make it starting at reboot

- the system should connect on AP if the system cannot connect on the recorded wifi (e.g not available) or the password is wrong.

 At the moment there is no check on the error for tha WiFi ....
